When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share your repository or make it accessible from the internet.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Your existing work may rely on the current code you are working with.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones on GitHub. Clones are copies of repositories. Branches are multiple commit paths within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can work offline and still merge or diff changes from the remote branch last time you were online.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would email or file transfer copies of the files, or use a cloud storage. It would be hard to keep track of changes and who made them. It would also be harder to keep a working version while we collaborate.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
